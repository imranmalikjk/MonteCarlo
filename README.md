# MonteCarlo


In credit risk modeling, regression techniques are routinely used to estimate the relationship between borrower characteristics and the probability of default (PD). In practice, beyond estimating
regression coefficients, it is equally important to quantify uncertainty. Simulation-based methods
such as Monte Carlo experiments and bootstrap resampling are widely used to answer questions
on how precise a coefficient estimate is, how reliable is its standard error, and so on.
This assignment focuses on a simplified regression setting designed to isolate and study these
sources of uncertainty.
